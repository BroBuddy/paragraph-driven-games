                Star Smuggler is a complex game. It is an entire role-playing
                experience which you conduct alone. In fact, Gamemasters of
                science fiction role-playing systems may wish to use this as an
                adventure or campaign guideline (with appropriate rules
                adjustments to suit their own RPG system). However, this game
                can be played many times, with many different results.
                Furthermore, the planets in the sector, and their attributes,
                can be changed from game to game for even greater variation.
