                Star Smuggler is a realistic solitaire adventure game. You play
                the game hour by hour, 10 hours of activity each day, and ten
                (10) days to the week. Each hour you decide whether youâ€™ll
                travel somewhere new, or stay in place and try to make a
                contact. Sometimes travel or a contact takes more than one hour.
                In either case, travel or contact will lead to the encounter
                tables, and an event will occur. You can spend an entire day
                just sitting in place resting, recuperating, repairing
                equipment, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the end of each day equipment break-down is checked, and
                salaries to your crewmen or other hirelings may be due. At the
                end of each 10-day week loan payments on your starship are due.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your objective is to make your fortune, which means paying off
                the loan for your starship, and hopefully making a few million
                besides! However, just staying alive and free is difficult
                enough in the dangerous worlds of the future!
